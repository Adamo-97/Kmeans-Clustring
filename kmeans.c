// function to pick k random centroids or k by user input

// function that counts assign points, here we will compute distances using euclidean distance and pick the nearest centroid

// function that recomputes the centroids as the mean of assigned points

// kmeans main function that calls the above functions iteratively until convergence

// notes to keep in mind:
// 1. handle edge cases like k > n or k <= 0
// 2. one cluster with no points assigned, we can reinitialize it randomly
// 3. convergence criteria, max iterations or centroids not changing significantly
// 4. performance considerations for large datasets, maybe use kd-trees or ball-trees for nearest neighbor search
